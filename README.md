## About
The **Computational Protocol for Assembly and Analysis of SARS-nCoV-2 Genomes** has been compiled by VS-Lab at [CSIR-Insitute of Genomics an Integrative Biology](https://www.igib.res.in/) as an effort to aid analysis and interpretation of the sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 using easy-to-use open source utilities using both reference-guided and de novo based strategies.
More information about out the lab and our work on COVID-19 can be found at the [lab website](http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/).
